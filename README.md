Comforts is a mod that adds sleeping bags and hammocks to Minecraft. These items can be used just
like beds except they do not set a player's spawn point on use, safely preserving a player's spawn
point at their home base. Just like beds, they also come in 16 different colors! The difference is
that sleeping bags can be stacked and are more convenient to use on adventures and hammocks are like
an inverse bed, turning day to night.

### Hammock
The recipe for the hammock cloth is simply a piece of colored wool in the center, sticks to the top
and bottom, and the rest of the slots are strings.
